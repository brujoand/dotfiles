# Shellcheck configuration for dotfiles
# Disable some checks that are common in dotfiles

# SC1090: ShellCheck can't follow non-constant source (dynamic completions)
# SC1091: Not following sourced files (common in dotfiles)
# SC2034: Variables that appear unused (common for exports)
# SC2039: In POSIX sh, 'local' is undefined (we use bash)
# SC2119: Use func "$@" if function's $1 should mean script's $1 (internal helper functions)
# SC2120: func references arguments, but none are ever passed (internal helper functions)
# SC2207: Prefer mapfile or read -a (bash completion patterns)
# SC2206: Quote to prevent word splitting (bash completion patterns)
# SC2250: Prefer putting braces around variable references (style preference)
# SC2068: Double quote array expansions (common pattern in dotfiles)
# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing (intentional in some cases)

# Keep important checks enabled:
# SC2016: Expressions don't expand in single quotes
# SC2046: Quote this to prevent word splitting
# SC2006: Use $(...) notation instead of legacy backticked `...`
